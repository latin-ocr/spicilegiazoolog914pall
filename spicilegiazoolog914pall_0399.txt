„flesh is good ὃ( nourishing, not inferior to the best Pork in taste ἃ is betwixt Beef ἀ
„Pork The young Coubs are a· most delicious dish, as most of the planters testifie,
„who prefer t-heir flesh before Beef, pot-k, veal or mutton3 ἆ it looks as well as it ears,-
„their fat being as white as Snow 8< the sweetest ofany Creature in the world, for if any
„Person dtinks a quart of it melted‚ it never riscs in the stomach, as other oils ὅ( fars
„are subjet} to do, ὅ( is preferr'd· above all things for fiying Fish. —— The Bacon made
„thereos is extraordinary good —- Jhave seen very good hams, made of these Bear’s-·
„flesh. These beasss feed upon all manner of wild fruits ἃ are great devourers of every
„sort of fish, especitlly Herrings, which they catch at rbe brook‘sfide in the month of
„March and Aprili The flesh of those Bears, that feed- upon them, is not good that
„Season ὅ( rats filthily3 neither are they good when they feed‘upon Gunberries. They
„are great devourers ofSwine, that they take in the woods, especially when they are
„ hungry δέ can get no other food, which is the only Fleshmeat they are fondof, They
„sometimes get into the Indian Cornfields or Maze, where they generally spoil ten times
‚, more than they eat. They are so fond ofthe Potatoes ofthis Country, that they sel-
„dom fail to destroy & root« out all clean, whenzver they chance ro come where they
„are — And notwithstanding they seem to be such a clumsy creature, yet they win
„nimbly climb trees (when pursued by Hunters ἃ Dogs), where they generally remain
‚‚ till sbot3 ἁ it is strange to see with what agility they will go up ἃ down the Trees,
„cst in coming down they always run tail for-ernost. They are likewise very dexterous
„& expett in fisbing, catching vast quantities of several forts of Fisb, as they run up the
„narrow creeks ἁ shallow waters to spawn, There you shall see these Beasts fit ἅ- take
„up fifh as fast as it is possible for them to dip their paws into the· water, There is one
„thing very strange 8( remarkable of this creature, which is that noffmnn, either Chri-
„stian or menan, ever killed a She—bear with young. -- 12- is most certain that they
„hide themselves in the most secret places, otheuvise the Indiam, who constantly hunt
„in the woods‚ ἄ killzthousands ofl-le-ones, would at some time or other have found
‚‚tl1em. — Bearhunting is a very great diver-{ion amongst Christians ἅ tudinum the
„former have a breed, of Dogs fit for that kind of syort, about the fize of {armet-s Curi-s3
